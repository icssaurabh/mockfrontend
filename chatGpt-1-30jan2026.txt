This error happens because you now have **two `Task` types**:

* one **imported**: `import { Task } from "@/api/tasks"`
* one **declared locally** in the same file: `type Task = { ... }`

TypeScript says: ❌ conflict.

# ✅ Fix (Recommended): Keep Task type only in API file and import it

### ✅ Step 1: Remove local Task type from page

In your page file DELETE this:

```ts
type Task = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  priority: string;
  status: string;
};
```

### ✅ Step 2: Import Task from API

At top of file:

```ts
import type { Task } from "@/api/tasks";
import { TasksAPI } from "@/api/tasks";
```

Now no conflict.
